# Physics-Simulations
These are some physics simulations that I started to create while taking AP Physics 1 and 2. I created them to not only better comprehend physics topics, but improve my classmates' physics skills.

The topics I have covered so far are Vectors, Electrostatics (Parallel Plates), and Magnetism (The Right Hand Rule).
I will add more in the future.

* [Vector Components](https://ashayp.com/vectorcomponents/)
* [The Right Hand Rule Game](https://ashayp.com/righthandrulegame/)
* [Parallel Plate Simulation](https://ashayp.com/parallelplatesimulation/)

The code for the projects is in this Git repository.
